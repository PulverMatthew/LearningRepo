Joculator Description:
Joculator is a clone of the popular poker-solitaire roguelite Balatro. The game will be built for the command line for simplicity. 
For simplicity, the program will only implement the basic game loop instead of copying the whole game.
The project will be constructed in the following parts:
    1. main.py
    2. jokers.py
    3. cards.py
The rest will be implemented later.
Basic game flow:
    1. Game shuffles given poker deck by picking a random card from the deck and creating a temporary deck for gameplay
    2. Game selects first x cards from the deck to give to the player based on defined hand size
    3. Player decides the cards to play/discard
    4. Discard discards then replaced discarded cards up to hand size, play adds the score value of the selected hand to total.
    5. Steps 3-4 loop based on number of plays/discards allowed until score value is obtained or 0 hands.
    6. Loop the game flow with higher score value requirement.
